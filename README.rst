Description
===========

Amoco is a python package dedicated to the (static) analysis of binaries.

It features:

- a generic framework for decoding instructions, developed to reduce
  the time needed to implement support for new architectures.
  For example the decoder for most IA32 instructions (general purpose)
  fits in less than 800 lines of Python.
  The full SPARCv8 RISC decoder (or the ARM THUMB-1 set as well) fits
  in less than 350 lines. The ARMv8 instruction set decoder is less than
  650 lines. See arch_ for details.
- a **symbolic** algebra module which allows to describe the semantics of
  every instructions and compute a functional representation of instruction
  blocks. See cas_ for details.
- a generic execution model wich provides an abstract memory model to deal
  with concrete or symbolic values transparently, and other system-dependent
  features. See system_ for details.
- various classes implementing usual disassembly techniques like linear sweep,
  recursive traversal, or more elaborated techniques like path-predicate
  which relies on SAT/SMT solvers to proceed with discovering the control
  flow graph or even to implement techniques like DARE (Directed Automated
  Random Exploration). See main.py_ for details.
- various generic "helpers" and arch-dependent pretty printers to allow
  custom look-and-feel configurations (think AT&T vs. Intel syntax,
  absolute vs. relative offsets, decimal or hex immediates, etc).
  See arch_ for details.

Amoco is still *work in progress*. See Todo_ for a list of features to be
merged from develop branch or to be more thoroughly implemented.


History
=======

Development started in late 2006 with a proof-of-concept for symbolic
interpretation of x86 ELF programs. At that time it used a modified
version of minisat_ for simplifying symbolic expressions.
In 2009, it was fully rewritten with support for various other architectures
(``z80, armv7/thumb``) and executable formats (``PE, Gameboy Cardridge``).
In 2013 the internal decoding system was redesigned, and the minisat solver
was replaced by z3_. The ``armv8`` and ``sparc`` architectures were added.

Despite being (just) yet another tool for analysing binaries,
in 2014 a dedicated 'release' branch was created with most of the above
features to be open-sourced.

Todo
====

Some components of Amoco are still in the
process of being pushed to the release branch or further developed.
More precisely:

- x86 fpu and sse decoder specs (``arch/x86/spec_{fpu,sse2}.pyÌ€``) are not implemented,
- arm v7 semantics (``arch/arm/v7/asm.py``) is currently not merged,
- arm SIMD, VFP, NEON, TrustZone, Jazelle instruction sets are not implemented,
- pretty printers based on pygments package are not merged,
- interface to z3 solver (and associated analysis) is currently not merged,
- backward and solver-based disassembling strategies are not merged yet.

Contributions to fulfill uncomplete/unimplemented parts are welcome.


Install
=======

Amoco is tested on python 2.7 and depends on the following python packages:

- grandalf_ used for building CFG (and eventually rendering it)
- crysp_    used by the generic intruction decoder (``arch/core.py``)
- z3_       (not in current release)
- pygments_ (not in current release)
- pyparsing_ for parsing instruction decoder formats
- ply_ (optional), for parsing *GNU as* files


Quickstart
==========

Below is a very simple example where basic blocks are built with linear sweep:

.. sourcecode:: python

 >>> import amoco
 >>> p = amoco.system.loader.load_program('tests/samples/flow.elf')
 amoco.system.loader: INFO: Elf32 file detected
 amoco.system.loader: INFO: linux_x86 program created
 >>> p
 <amoco.system.linux_x86.ELF object at 0x8b23d4c>


We are analysing file ``flow.elf``. Since we don't know nothing about it
we start by using a high level loader which will try to detect its format
and target platform and provide some feedback info. Here the loader
creates a ``linux_x86.ELF`` object which shall represent the program task.


.. sourcecode:: python

 >>> p.bin
 <amoco.system.elf.Elf32 object at 0xb721a48c>
 >>> print p.mmap
 <MemoryZone rel=None :
          <mo [08048000,08049ff0] data:'\x7fELF\x01\x01\x01\x00\x00\x00...>
          <mo [08049ff0,08049ff4] data:@__gmon_start__>
          <mo [08049ff4,0804a000] data:'(\x9f\x04\x08\x00\x00\x00\x00\x...>
          <mo [0804a000,0804a004] data:@__stack_chk_fail>
          <mo [0804a004,0804a008] data:@malloc>
          <mo [0804a008,0804a00c] data:@__gmon_start__>
          <mo [0804a00c,0804a010] data:@__libc_start_main>
          <mo [0804a010,0804a02c] data:'\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x0...>>
 <MemoryZone rel=esp :>
 >>> p.mmap.read(0x0804a004,4)
 [<amoco.cas.expressions.ext object at 0x8cff054>]
 >>> print _[0]
 @malloc
 >>> p.mmap.read(0x0804a00c,6)
 [<amoco.cas.expressions.ext object at 0x8cff0a4>, '\x00\x00']


The object gives access to the Elf32 object and its mapping in our abstract
memory model. We can note that in this model, imports location in .got segment
are modeled as abstract expressions of type ``ext``. Note also that fetching
compound data (symbolic+concrete) is possible. See MemoryZone_ for more details.
Lets proceed with getting some basic blocks...

.. sourcecode:: python

 >>> z = amoco.lsweep(p)
 >>> ib = z.iterblocks()
 >>> next(ib)
 <block object (name=0x8048380) at 0x09e8939c>
 >>> b=_
 >>> print b
 # --- block 0x8048380 ---
 0x8048380  31ed                           xor         ebp,ebp
 0x8048382  5e                             pop         esi
 0x8048383  89e1                           mov         ecx,esp
 0x8048385  83e4f0                         and         esp,0xfffffff0
 0x8048388  50                             push        eax
 0x8048389  54                             push        esp

 0x8048396  56                             push        esi
 0x8048397  68fd840408                     push        #main
 0x804839c  e8cfffffff                     call        *0x8048370
 >>> b.instr
 [<amoco.arch.x86.spec_ia32 [0x8048380]  XOR ( length=2 type=1 )>, <amoco.arch.x86.spec_ia32 [0x8048382]  POP ( length=1 type=1 )>, <amoco.arch.x86.spec_ia32 [0x8048383]  MOV ( length=2 type=1 )>, <amoco.arch.x86.spec_ia32 [0x8048385]  AND ( length=3 type=1 )>, <amoco.arch.x86.spec_ia32 [0x8048388]  PUSH ( length=1 type=1 )>, <amoco.arch.x86.spec_ia32 [0x8048389]  PUSH ( length=1 type=1 )>, <amoco.arch.x86.spec_ia32 [0x804838a]  PUSH ( length=1 type=1 )>, <amoco.arch.x86.spec_ia32 [0x804838b]  PUSH ( length=5 type=1 )>, <amoco.arch.x86.spec_ia32 [0x8048390]  PUSH ( length=5 type=1 )>, <amoco.arch.x86.spec_ia32 [0x8048395]  PUSH ( length=1 type=1 )>, <amoco.arch.x86.spec_ia32 [0x8048396]  PUSH ( length=1 type=1 )>, <amoco.arch.x86.spec_ia32 [0x8048397]  PUSH ( length=5 type=1 )>, <amoco.arch.x86.spec_ia32 [0x804839c]  CALL ( length=5 type=2 )>]
 >>> i = b.instr[-1]
 >>> i
 <amoco.arch.x86.spec_ia32 [0x804839c]  CALL ( length=5 type=2 )>
 >>> print i
 0x804839c  e8cfffffff                     call        *0x8048370

 >>> str(i.operands[0])

 >>> i.operands[0].value

We use here the most basic **linear sweep** approach and spawn a basic
block iterator. The first block is well known. We can see that the default
x86 pretty printer uses Intel syntax and codehelpers that show PLT refs
as associated .got ``ext`` expression. Also, relative offsets are displayed
as absolute addresses (indicated by the \* prefix).

Lets look at the symbolic execution of this block:

.. sourcecode:: python

 >>> b.map
 <amoco.cas.mapper.mapper object at 0x9cba3ec>
 >>> print b.map
 ebp <- { | [0:32]->0x0 | }
 esi <- { | [0:32]->M32(esp) | }
 ecx <- { | [0:32]->(esp+0x4) | }
 eflags <- { | [0:1]->0x0 | [6:7]->((((esp+0x4)&0xfffffff0)==0x0) ? 0x1 : 0x0) | [12:32]->eflags[12:32] | [11:12]->0x0 | [8:11]->eflags[8:11] | [1:6]->eflags[1:6] | [7:8]->((((esp+0x4)&0xfffffff0)<0x0) ? 0x1 : 0x0) | }
 ((((esp+0x4)&0xfffffff0)-0x4)) <- eax
 ((((esp+0x4)&0xfffffff0)-0x8)) <- (((esp+0x4)&0xfffffff0)-0x4)
 ((((esp+0x4)&0xfffffff0)-0xc)) <- edx
 ((((esp+0x4)&0xfffffff0)-0x10)) <- 0x8048610
 ((((esp+0x4)&0xfffffff0)-0x14)) <- 0x80485a0
 ((((esp+0x4)&0xfffffff0)-0x18)) <- (esp+0x4)
 ((((esp+0x4)&0xfffffff0)-0x1c)) <- M32(esp)
 ((((esp+0x4)&0xfffffff0)-0x20)) <- 0x80484fd
 esp <- { | [0:32]->(((esp+0x4)&0xfffffff0)-0x24) | }
 ((((esp+0x4)&0xfffffff0)-0x24)) <- (eip+0x21)
 eip <- { | [0:32]->(eip+-0x10) | }
 >>> b.map[p.cpu.esi]
 <amoco.cas.expressions.mem object at 0x8b2fa6c>
 >>> e=_
 >>> print e
 M32(esp)
 >>> e.length
 4
 >>> e.size
 32


When a block is instanciated, a ``mapper`` object is automatically created.
This function can map any input state to an output state corresponding to the
interpretation of this block.

-----

Lets try a (little) more elaborated analysis that will not only allow to
build a list of basic blocks but will also help us discover (parts of)
the control flow graph of the program:

.. sourcecode:: python

 >>> ff = amoco.fforward(p)
 >>> ff.policy
 {'depth-first': True, 'branch-lazy': True}
 >>> ff.policy['branch-lazy']=False
 >>> ff.getcfg()
 amoco.cas.expressions: INFO: stub __libc_start_main called
 amoco.main: INFO: fforward analysis failed at block 0x8048370
 <amoco.cfg.func object at 0xb72e330c>
 >>> G=_
 >>> G.C
 [<grandalf.graphs.graph_core object at 0x8f6d78c>]

Here we use the **fast-forward** analysis (see below) and set its "branch-lazy" policy
to ``False`` to avoid falling back to linear sweep when analysis of branch fails.
Interestingly, we can see that the PLT jump to ``__libc_start_main`` external function
has been followed thanks to a ``@stub`` defined for this external (see ``system/linux_x86.py``).

Let's have a look at the graph instance:

.. sourcecode:: python

 >>> print G.C[0].sV
 0.| <node [0x8048380] at 0x8db764c>
 1.| <node [0x8048370] at 0x8db740c>
 >>> print G.C[0].sE
 0.| <link [0x8048380 -> 0x8048370] at 0x8db742c>
 >>> G.get_node('0x8048370')
 <node [0x8048370] at 0x8db740c>
 >>> n=_
 >>> print n.data
 # --- block 0x8048370 ---
 0x8048370  'ff250ca00408'     jmp         [@__libc_start_main]
 >>> print n.data.map
 eip <- { | [0:32]->M32((esp+0x4)) | }
 esp <- { | [0:32]->(esp-0x4) | }
 ((esp-0x4)) <- @exit

Ok, so the program counter is correctly pointing to the ``#main`` address located
at offset +4 in the stack, but since the fast-forward method only look at one block,
it cannot know that this location holds this address.
A little more elaborated analysis like **link-forward** would have started analysing
``#main``:

.. sourcecode:: python

 >>> lf = amoco.lforward(p)
 >>> lf.getcfg()
 amoco.cas.expressions: INFO: stub __libc_start_main called
 amoco.main: INFO: lforward analysis failed at block 0x8048483

Overview
========

Amoco is composed of 3 packages arch_, cas_ and system_, on top of which the
classes implemented in ``code.py``, ``cfg.py`` and ``main.py`` provide high-level
abstractions of basic blocks, functions, control flow graphs and
disassembling/analysis techniques.

We will now describe this architecture starting from low-level layers (arch_, cas_)
up to system_ and finally to higher level classes.

arch
----

Supported CPU architectures are implemented in this package as subpackages and all
use the ``arch/core.py`` generic classes. The interface to a CPU used by
system_ classes is generally provided by a ``cpu_XXX.py`` module in the CPU subpackage.
This module shall:

- provide the CPU *environment* (registers and other internals)
- provide an instance of ``core.disassembler`` class, which requires to:

  + define the ``@ispec`` of every instruction for the generic decoder,
  + and define the *semantics* of every instruction with cas_ expressions.

- optionnally define the output assembly format, and the *GNU as* (or any other)
  assembly parser.

A simple example is provided by the ``arch/arm/v8`` architecture which provides
a model of ARM AArch64:
The interface module is ``arch/arm/cpu_armv8.py``, which imports everything from
the v8 subpackage.

instruction specifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``v8/spec_armv8.py`` module implements all decoding specifications thanks
to an original decorating mechanism. For example, the EXTR instruction encoding
is defined like this:

.. sourcecode:: python

 @ispec("32[ sf 0 0 100111 N 0 Rm(5) imms(6) Rn(5) Rd(5) ]",mnemonic="EXTR")
 def A64_EXTR(obj,sf,N,Rm,imms,Rn,Rd):
     if sf!=N: raise InstructionError(obj)
     if sf==0 and imms>31: raise InstructionError(obj)
     obj.datasize = 64 if (sf==1) else 32
     regs = env.Xregs if sf==1 else env.Wregs
     obj.d = sp2z(regs[Rd])
     obj.n = sp2z(regs[Rn])
     obj.m = sp2z(regs[Rm])
     obj.lsb = env.cst(imms,6)
     obj.operands = [obj.d,obj.n,obj.m,obj.lsb]
     obj.type = type_data_processing


The ``@ispec(...)`` decorator indicates that whenever the decoder buffer is filled
with 32 bits that matches a given pattern, the decorated function is called with
first argument being a ``arch.core.instruction`` instance with ``mnemonic`` attribute
set to EXTR, and other arguments being extracted from corresponding bitfields.
The function itself is responsible for filling the instruction instance with useful
other attributes like operands, type, etc.
If you look at page 480 of armv8_, you will likely feel at home...

The same is true for ``x86/spec_ia32.py`` and the Intel manuals, for example
the CMOVcc instruction(s) specification is:

.. sourcecode:: python

 # conditionals:
 @ispec_ia32("*>[ {0f} cc(4) 0010 /r ]", mnemonic = "CMOVcc") # 0f 4x /r
 def ia32_CMOVcc(obj,cc,Mod,RM,REG,data):
     obj.cond = CONDITION_CODES[cc]
     op2,data = getModRM(obj,Mod,RM,data)
     op1 = env.getreg(REG,op2.size)
     obj.operands = [op1, op2]
     obj.type = type_data_processing

.. **

A detailed description of the ispec decorator class pattern format is provided in
``arch/core.py``. Since implementing these specifications from CPUs docs
is always error-prone, Amoco will check several things for you:

- the size of the ispec format (the "pattern" to match) is consistent with its declared length (if not \*).
- the prototype of the decorated function match the identifiers in the ispec format (count and names must match).
- the ispec format is unique: the fixed part of the pattern does not exist in any other ispec instance.

Internally, the decoder will collect all ispec instances declared within the module.
The ``core.disassembler`` setup will later organize the list in a tree based on fixed patterns of each ispec.
Note that identifying *holes* of the architecture's encoding scheme becomes relatively simple once this tree
is built.
Architectures with multiple (disjoint) instructions sets (think armv7/thumb) is supported by instanciating
the core disassembler with respective specs modules and with the function that decides how to switch
from one set to the other.

instruction semantics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The semantics of instructions are defined separately from their decoder specs,
generally in a ``asm.py`` module. An ``instruction`` instance with mnemonic *XXX*
will find its semantics definition by looking for a function ``i_XXX(i,fmap): ...``.

For example (in ``arch/x86/asm.py``):

.. sourcecode:: python

 def i_CMOVcc(i,fmap):
   op1 = i.operands[0]
   op2 = fmap(i.operands[1])
   fmap[eip] = fmap[eip]+i.length
   a = fmap(op1)
   fmap[op1] = tst(fmap(i.cond[1]),op2,a)

The function takes as input the instruction instance *i* and a ``mapper``
instance *fmap* (see cas_) and implements (an approximation of) the opcode semantics.

instruction formats
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

How an instruction object is printed is also defined separately to allow various
outputs. A ``Formatter`` instance can be associated to the core instruction class
to handle "pretty printing", including aliases of instructions.

Basically, a ``Formatter`` object is created from a dict associating a key with a list
of functions or format string. The key is either one of the mnemonics or possibly
the name of a ispec-decorated function (this allows to group formatting styles
rather than having to declare formats for every possible mnemonic.)
When the instruction is printed, the formatting list elements are "called" and
concatenated to produce the output string.

An example follows from ``arch/x86/formats.py``:

.. sourcecode:: python

 def mnemo(i):
    mnemo = i.mnemonic.replace('cc','')
    if hasattr(i,'cond'): mnemo += i.cond[0].split('/')[0]
    return '{: <12}'.format(mnemo.lower())

 def opsize(i):
     s = [op.size for op in i.operands if op._is_mem]
     if len(s)==0: return ''
     m = max(s)
     return {8:'byte ptr ',16:'word ptr ',32:''}[m]

 ...
 format_intel_ptr = (mnemo,opsize,opers)
 ...
 IA32_Intel_formats = {
     ....
     'ia32_mov_adr' : format_intel_ptr,
     'ia32_ptr_ib'  : format_intel_ptr,
     ...
 }

The formatter is also used to take care of aliasing instructions like for example
in the arm architectures where the *ANDS* instruction is replaced by *TST* when
the destination register is X0/W0 :

.. sourcecode:: python

 def alias_AND(i):

The *computer algebra system* of Amoco is built with the following elements implemented
in ``cas/expressions.py``:

- Constant ``cst``, which represents immediate (signed or unsigned) value of fixed size (bitvector),
- Symbol ``sym``, a Constant equipped with a reference string (non-external symbol),
- Register ``reg``, a fixed size CPU register **location**,
- External ``ext``, a reference to an external location (external symbol),
- Composite ``comp``, a bitvector composed of several elements,
- Pointer ``ptr``, a memory **location** in a segment, with possible displacement,
- Memory ``mem``, a Pointer to represent a value of fixed size in memory,
- Slice ``slc``, a bitvector slice of any element,
- Test ``tst``, a conditional expression, (see Tests_ below.)
- Operator ``op``, an operation on (1 or 2) elements. The list of supported operations is
  not fixed althrough several predefined operators allow to build expressions directly from
  Python expressions: say, you don't need to write ``op('+',x,y)``, but can write ``x+y``.
  Supported operators are:

  + ``+``, ``-``, ``*`` (multiply low), ``**`` (multiply extended), ``/``
  + ``&``, ``|``, ``^``, ``~``
  + ``==``, ``!=``, ``<=``, ``>=``, ``<``, ``>``
  + ``>>``, ``<<``, ``//`` (arithmetic shift right), ``>>>`` and ``<<<`` (rotations).

  See Operators_ for more details.

All elements inherit from the ``exp`` class which defines all default methods/properties.
Common attributes and methods for all elements are:

- ``size``,  a Python integer representing the size in bits,
- ``sf``,    the True/False *sign-flag*.
- ``length`` (size/8)
- ``mask``   (1<<size)-1
- extend methods (``signextend``, ``zeroextend``)

All manipulation of an expression object usually result in a new expression object except for
``simplify()`` which performs in-place elementary simplifications.

Constants
~~~~~~~~~

Some examples of ``cst`` and ``sym`` expressions follow:

.. sourcecode:: python

 >>> from amoco.cas.expressions import *
 >>> c = cst(253,8)
 >>> print c
 0xfd
 >>> c.sf
 False
 >>> c.sf=True
 >>> print c
 -0x3
 >>> print c.value, type(c.value)
 -3 <type 'int'>
 >>> print c.v, c.mask, c.size
 253 255 8
 >>> c.zeroextend(16)
 <amoco.cas.expressions.cst object at 0xb728df4c>
 >>> c2 = _
 >>> print c2.sf, c2
 False 0xfd
 >>> e = c2+c.signextend(16)+5
 >>> print e
 0xff
 >>> c3 = e[0:8]
 >>> print c3==cst(-1,8)
 0x0
 >>> c3.sf=True
 >>> print c3==cst(-1,8)
 0x1

Here, after declaring an 8-bit constant with value 253, we can see that by default the
associated ``cst`` object is unsigned. The internal storage is always the unsigned
representation of the value. If we set its ``sf`` *sign-flag* attribute to True,
the ``value`` property will return a signed Python integer.
If the constant is inited from a negative integer, the resulting object's *sign-flag* is set to True.
If a constant is *signextended* its *sign-flag* is set automatically, unset if *zeroextended*.
Basically, during interpretation, the flag is set or unset depending on how the expression is
used by the instructions. Logical operators tend to unset it, explicit sign-relevant instructions
need to set it.

The ``cst`` class is special because it is the only class that can be used as a
Python boolean type:

.. sourcecode:: python

 >>> e==0xff
 <amoco.cas.expressions.cst object at 0x9efd7ac>
 >>> t=_
 >>> print t
 0x1
 >>> if t==True: print 'OK'
 ... 
 OK
 >>> t.size
 1

In above examples, the ``==`` Python operator is used. The return value is not a Python
True/False value but as expected a new expression object. Since the operation here involves
only constants, the result need not be an ``op`` element but can be readily simplified to
a 1-bit constant with value 0 or 1.
In Amoco, the **only** expression that evaluates to True is ``cst(1,1)``.

Expressions of type ``sym`` are constants equipped with a symbol string for printing purpose only:

.. sourcecode:: python

 >>> s = sym('Hubble',42,8)
 >>> print s
 #Hubble
 >>> s.value
 42
 >>> print s+1
 0x2b

(Note that as seen above, usage of a ``sym`` object in another expression will obviously
forget the symbol string in the resulting expression.)

Registers
~~~~~~~~~

Expressions of class ``reg`` are pure symbolic values.
They are essentially used for representing the registers of a CPU, as "right-values"
or left-values (locations). More details on *locations* in mapper_.

.. sourcecode:: python

 >>> r1 = reg('%r1',32)
 >>> print r1
 %r1
 >>> e = 2+r1
 >>> print e
 (0x2+%r1)
 >>> x = e-2
 >>> print x
 (0x0+%r1)
 >>> x.simplify()
 <amoco.cas.expressions.reg object at 0xb7250f6c>
 >>> print _
 %r1

As shown above, elementary simplification rules are applied such that ``(2+r1)-2``
leads to an ``op`` expression with operator ``+``, left member 0 and right member ``r1``,
which eventually also simplifies further to the r1 register.
Most real simplification rules should rely on SMT solvers like z3_ [TBC].

Externals
~~~~~~~~~

Class ``ext`` inherit from registers as pure symbolic values
but is used to represent external symbols that are equipped with a ``stub`` function.
When "called", these objects invoke their stub function.
(More details on ``@stub`` decorated functions are provided in system_.)

Pointers and Memory objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A ``ptr`` object is a memory **location**. These objects are generally not found
in expressions but only as mapper locations or addresses in ``mem`` objects.
These objects have a ``base`` expression, and optional ``disp`` and ``seg`` fields
to be used by MemoryZone_ objects.

A ``mem`` object is a symbolic memory value equipped with a pointer and a size.
There is no direct relation between such expression and a MemoryZone_ state. It is
up to analysis methods to eventually update states according to such expressions.

Operators
~~~~~~~~~

Most operations in Amoco involve left and right members sub-expressions. The operation
will then usually proceed only if both member have the same size. If one member is not
an expression but a Python integer, it will be implicitly "casted" to a constant of size
required by the other expression member. Thus, it is possible to write ``r1+2`` and not
``r1+cst(2,32)``.

main.py
-------

This module contains *high-level* analysis techniques implemented as classes that
take a program abstraction provided by the system_ package.
Currently, only 3 simple techniques are released:

- *linear-sweep* (``lsweep`` class) disassembles instructions without taking
  into account any branching instruction.

  Methods exposed by the ``lsweep`` class are:

  * ``sequence(loc=None)``: returns an iterator that will yield disassembled
    instructions starting at virtual address *loc* (defaults to entrypoint).
  * ``iterblocks(loc=None)``: which returns an iterator that will yield (basic) block_
    of instructions starting at virtual address *loc*.

- *fast forward* (``fforward``) inherits from ``lsweep`` and adds an algorithm that
  tries to build the control-flow graph of the program by following branching
  instructions when the program counter is composed essentially of constant
  expressions when evaluated within block scope only.
  The default policy is to fallback to linear sweep otherwise.

- *link forward* (``lforward``) inherits from ``fforward`` but uses a strict
  follow branch policy to avoid linear sweep and evaluates the program counter
  by taking into account the parent block semantics.
